two scope cases

1 - global variables
     - local variables comprise the entire body of the program
2 - local variables
     - are recognized only in the block where they were declared

to declare a variable we do

variable_name = variable_value

python is a dynamic typing language

when we declare a variable, we don't put its data type
This type is inferred by assigning the value the same
